# Literary-predictor

This project is the implementation of my coursework on the topic: *Predicting the user's evaluation of a literary work based on lexical and syntactic parameters using machine learning methods*

There are some steps to execute:
- Collect data and build a curpus
- Parse LitRes to scrape text's evaluation -- **Now we are here**
- Extract lexical and syntactic features
- Determine if there is any correlation between the rating and the complexity of the text
- Build a model to predict the estimate
